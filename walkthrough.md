# Creating Image Files Using PBM, PGM, and PPM Formats

## 1. Understand the Formats
- **PBM (Portable Bitmap):** Represents binary images (black and white), with each pixel being either black (0) or white (1).
- **PGM (Portable Graymap):** Represents grayscale images, where each pixel has a value representing its intensity level.
- **PPM (Portable Pixmap):** Represents color images, with each pixel having separate red, green, and blue color components.

## 2. Creating the Image
- Decide on the dimensions of your image (width and height).
- For PBM, your image will consist of 0s and 1s representing black and white pixels.
- For PGM, your image will consist of grayscale values ranging typically from 0 to 255.
- For PPM, your image will consist of RGB tuples, usually represented in decimal format.

## 3. Writing the File
- Each format has its own structure for representing image data.
- All formats start with a header specifying the image type, width, height, and maximum value (for PGM and PPM).
- After the header, the actual image data follows.

## 4. Sample Code
```python
width = 3
height = 2
max_color_value = 255

ppm_image = f'P3\n{width} {height}\n{max_color_value}\n'
pixels = [
    (255, 0, 0),  # Red
    (0, 255, 0),  # Green
    (0, 0, 255),  # Blue
    (255, 255, 0),  # Yellow
    (255, 0, 255),  # Magenta
    (0, 255, 255)  # Cyan
]

for pixel in pixels:
    ppm_image += f'{pixel[0]} {pixel[1]} {pixel[2]}\n'

with open('output.ppm', 'w') as file:
    file.write(ppm_image)
```
- You can modify this code to generate PBM or PGM images by adjusting the format and the way you represent pixel data.
- For PBM, you would use 0s and 1s instead of RGB tuples.
- For PGM, you would use grayscale values instead of RGB tuples.
- The header format also changes slightly for each format.
- You can find more detailed specifications for each format online.

## 5. Viewing the Image
- After creating the image file, you can view it using an image viewer or editor that supports the PBM, PGM, or PPM format.
- You can also convert the image to other formats using image processing libraries or tools.
- For example, you can use the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to convert PBM, PGM, or PPM images to other formats like PNG or JPEG.
- You can also use command-line tools like ImageMagick to perform format conversions.
